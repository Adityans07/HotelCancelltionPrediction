# **Hotel Booking cancellation prediction**
The hotel industry is highly competitive and has a significant impact on the global economy. One of the major challenges in hotel management is predicting cancellations, which can lead to significant revenue loss. In this research paper, we explore the use of machine learning algorithms to predict hotel booking cancellations. We use historical data from a hotel chain and apply various machine learning techniques to develop a cancellation prediction model. Our results show that machine learning algorithms can accurately predict cancellations, which can help hotel managers to better manage their resources and revenue.
Hotels rely heavily on accurate booking predictions to manage their resources effectively. Accurately predicting cancellations can help managers to plan better and optimize their staffing, inventory, and pricing strategies. With the rise of online booking platforms, hotels face increased competition, and cancellations can significantly impact their revenue. Therefore, it is crucial to develop effective cancellation prediction models to manage hotel resources efficiently.
We focus on developing a machine learning model to predict cancellations in the hotel industry. We use historical data from a hotel chain and apply various machine learning algorithms to develop a prediction model. Our objective is to provide hotel managers with a tool that can accurately predict cancellations and help them make informed decisions.
